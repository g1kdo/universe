The system architecture diagrams below are generated using Mermaid (Diagrams as Code).

If any of the diagrams—including the Class, Use Case, Activity, or Deployment diagrams—fail to render and display an "Unable to render rich display" message, please try refreshing the page once or twice. GitHub's rendering engine sometimes requires a quick refresh to fully process the complex Mermaid syntax.
